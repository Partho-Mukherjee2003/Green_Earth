#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
  var is the old style for variables and it can sometimes cause bugs because you can use it anywhere in your code. let and const are better because they only work inside the {} where you make them. Use let if you need to change the value later, and use const if the value should stay the same

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
forEach is just for looping through a list to do something, but it doesn't give you anything back. map is different because it changes every item in the list and gives you a new list with those changes. filter is used to pick only the items you want from a list and put them in a new one.


#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
Arrow functions are just a shorter way to write functions without using the word function. They look cleaner and are usually written on one line. The best part is how they handle the this keyword, which makes them very helpful when you are working inside objects or timers.



#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
Destructuring is a cool shortcut to grab values from arrays or objects very quickly. Instead of writing many lines to get data, you can do it in just one line using {} for objects or [] for arrays. It makes your code look much shorter and easier to understand.


#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
Template literals let you write strings using backticks (`) instead of quotes. In the old way, you had to use the + sign to join words and variables, which was messy. With template literals, you just put variables inside ${} and you can even write on many lines very easily.
