#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
  var is the old way of declaring variables that is function-scoped and can be redeclared, which often causes bugs in larger projects. Unlike the old way, let and const are block-scoped, meaning they only work inside the specific curly braces {} where they are written. You should use let for values that need to change later, while const should be used for values that must stay the same throughout your code.
